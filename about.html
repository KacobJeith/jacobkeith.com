<h1> My name is Jacob Keith. </h1>

I am a graduate of Columbia University, where I majored in Materials Science & Engineering. While I didn't formally receive any degree due to the Engineering School's policy of not granting BA degrees to BS students, I may as well have double-majored in Mandarin as well, for no particular reason other than genuine interest in the language. I was fortunate enough to land an awesome job right out of college that combined my interest in both materials and Mandarin at <a href="http://www.nanotronics.co"> Nanotronics Imaging </a>, where I spent my first 3.5 years after graduation working to build an <a href="http://www.nanotronics.co/technology">automated inspection system for semiconductor manufacturers</a> as a Computer Vision Engineer -> Project Lead -> Product Director. The gig took me all over the world, most frequently to Taiwan and Japan, and was loads of fun. I settled down in Brooklyn, and have pivoted to work on developing some of my own ideas. More on that later. <br><br>

My professional interests span Project Management, Computer Vision, Embedded Systems, Networking, and most recently Front end Design (what good are backend skills if you lack the vehicle to present them to the world?). Some of my secret(/not-so-secret) interests include space tech, music, severe weather dynamics, photography, and Chinese Language. For better or worse, I tend more towards the jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none end of the spectrum. When it comes down to it, I just want to build cool stuff with interesting people.
