After a week waiting in eager anticipation, all my computer parts have arrived, and my first custom-built computer is all put together. So far I'm ecstatic with the result.

<hr>

In all the PC cost me $1126.05 for everything excluding the monitor, with the grand total coming to $1425.05. My first impression is that this is going to be an awesome computer to have at home for anything ranging from development to gaming and entertainment. Currently I'm running windows 10, and while I've considered jumping to Linux, so far I've managed to work around some of the classic Windows web-dev setbacks. Chantal is pretty excited that she'll finally have a proper station she use to run her 3D photogrammetry models (Have I mentioned how awesome my girlfriend is?). During our first photogrammetry test run, this PC built the sparse point cloud in < 2hrs, a major improvement from her Macbook Pro which sometimes took over 48hrs for a lower resolution rendering.

I have mixed feelings thus far about the 4K monitor. At first when using the full resolution my mouse felt a bit laggy, but after fiddling with the settings it seems to be better (not certain what it was that I changed...). I haven't put it through the rigors of playing Rust, my current guilty pleasure which happens to also be notoriously underoptimized, so stay tuned for a gaming update on the 6700K-GTX1060-4k combo in a future update. I do wish it were a bit larger, but couldn't bring myself to fork over the extra $100, since I was trying to stay reasonable keep this build relatively frill-free while still enjoying the luxuries of living in 2016. Speaking of which, this SSD is LIGHTNING FAST. It stomps all over every other hard drive I have ever used (sorry to my good friends over in the WD Read-Write Head fab). This SSD is the future. And it's so compact!

Temperatures under standard use seem to run pretty low - right now my system is running at (CPU: 29.8C, Disk: 37.0C, GPU 52.0C). To be perfectly honest, I don't yet know enough if those are numbers that merit celebration or cause for concern, but based random internet posts I've seen they seem on the low side. 

Computer build success! Now for the real fun.
