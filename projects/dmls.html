                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing technology that NASA hopes to utilize to produce complex J-2X engine parts made of Inconel 718, a nickel-chromium super alloy. We performed a comprehensive series of tensile, low and high cycle fatigue, fracture toughness, and fatigue crack growth tests at temperatures ranging from -320F to 1200F. NASA used this data to determine whether or not DMLS Inconel 718 is an acceptable replacement for wrought Inconel 718. Ultimately this study will help NASA improve the strength, durability, and reliability of parts that currently require strength-reducing welding processes to manufacture, while simultaneously reducing cost of production.

            <p class="text-indent">      Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing technology that succeeds in producing metallic parts with properties very similar to traditional wrought manufactured parts. NASA is interested in the technology because DMLS parts can be “printed” without the need to join and weld multiple pieces together. Welding is typically associated with a Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), inside which material strength and other properties are significantly compromised. Another recent technological innovation to avoid the weakening effects of the heat affected zone is Friction Stir Welding (FSW). Friction Stir Welding works well on large, straight, relatively flat surfaces, but small geometrically complex parts must still be manufactured by some of the more traditional joining techniques such as Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) Welding or Electron Beam Welding (EBW). Both TIG welding and EBW are accompanied by a heat affected zone where material properties such as tensile and fatigue strength are compromised due to increased likeliness of cracks and brittleness. 
            
            <BR/> <BR/> NASA builds rocket engines, and most of the material in a rocket engine must not only withstand, but continue operating nominally despite being exposed to extremely severe environments. Over time, materials such as Inconel superalloys, Aluminum-Lithium alloys, and carbon composites have been developed to meet the stringent demands of Aerospace Engineering design, but regions around welds and other stress concentrators are theoretically and historically prime candidate points of origin for failure regardless of bulk material strength. Direct Metal Laser Sintering, or Selective Laser Melting (SLM) as NASA calls it, essentially eliminates the need to join by welding, and in doing so removes much of the uncertainty and risk associated with the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ). Ultimately, the hope is that DMLS is a process that can cut time and cost while enabling the manufacture of stronger, more cohesive, more reliable parts.
